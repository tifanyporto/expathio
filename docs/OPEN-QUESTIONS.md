# Expathio — Open Questions

**Status:** APPROVED  
**Document type:** Question register  
**Project:** Expathio  
**Owner of this file:** Product and Documentation (`docs/SESSION-STRUCTURE.md`, section 3.1)

---

## How to Use This File

- One entry per open question. A question that needs a decision from another session goes here, not only in that session's record.
- The session that has the question adds the entry, with the function it is addressed to.
- The session that answers writes the answer in the entry, and links the decision record (`docs/decisions/`) if one was made.
- No session closes an entry on its own. Only the owner closes it (`CLAUDE.md`, section 5).
- Statuses follow `CLAUDE.md`, section 4. Use PROPOSED for questions not yet discussed, and IN DISCUSSION for questions being evaluated.
- Decisions are not recorded here. They go to `docs/decisions/`, and the entry only points to them.
